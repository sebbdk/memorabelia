- Undefined adventure

		He finds himself standing a inconcivable place
		Who is he? how did he get here? where did all the potato salad go?

		- take a look around

		//- i am not gonna play you games, i call shinanigans!

		A even soft white light fills your surroundings, your shadow seems to drop from unseen lightsource.

		- look for the light source
		- try to think
			* you try to think, but you have nothing to think about, or maybe you are just daft?

		You take a look at your surroundings (use WASD to move)

		(After walking around for 10 seconds a anomaly appears)

		You pick up the weird glowy thing, having no idea what it is you name it Bilbo.

		- look around some more, maybere there's more Bilbo's aying around!!
			(after 15 second of walking around)
			not being able to find anything you stop, you decide to stop think about you actions
				- you actions where most horrendous! surely you are evil!
					you laugh like a loon for a few minutes
				- take better look at bilbo, surely this precious thing is worth it!

		you take a good look at bilbo, he seems to remind you of something, but you cannot seem to recall it.
			- think harder!
				you pop a vein in your forehead thinking about this and suddonly it strikes you, wasn't bilbo in a book you once read?
			- try to swallow bilbo, maybe the taste will jog your mind!
				this thing has the distinctive taste of hobbit! but what does it mean?


- That level where he stands on a piller doing stuff 

	Being swoopt away somehow you suddonly find you self standing on a large piller high in the sky.

	You take a look at the bookshelf, it has a few books in it, they look rather dull, you do see on book of interest tho. It is labelled "Why you are here."
		- take the oh so interesting book
			You pick you the book
				- throw the book over the side
					You take a good firm grib on the book and throw it with all you strength, it really was a good book for throwing
						- take another look at the books
						- walk away, there are no more good throwables
		- walk away, too many words around here..

	You take a look at the bookshelf again
		- take another look at the books
		- walk away, too many words for one day..
